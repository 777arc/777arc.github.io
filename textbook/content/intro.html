<h1>Intro<a class="headerlink" href="#intro" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>First and foremost, let’s get a couple important abbreviations out of the way:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>SDR - Software-Defined Radio</li>
<li>DSP - Digital Signal Processing</li>
</ul>
<p>This textbook is designed for someone who is:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Interested in <em>using</em> SDRs to do awesome things</li>
<li>Good with Python</li>
<li>New to DSP and wireless communications (and SDR)</li>
<li>Better at understanding equations <em>after</em> learning the concepts</li>
<li>A visual learner, prefering animations over equations</li>
<li>Looking for concise explainations, i.e. a quicker read</li>
</ol>
<p>A perfect candidate might be a student towards the end of a Computer Science degree, interested in getting a job involving wireless communications after graduation.  If you don’t have much Python experience but are an expert with MATLAB, Ruby, or Perl, then you will probably be fine, just spend some time getting a feel for Pythonic syntax.  If you are a soon to be graduating CS student who does not know Python, hold off on learning SDR for a little while, because learning straight Python instead is likely to help out wherever you end up after school, so go hit the YouTube tutorials.</p>
<p>This textbook is meant to propel a student as quickly and smoothly as possible through many difficult concepts, in order to be able to perform DSP and use SDRs intelligently.  There is plenty of great reference material already out there, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/software-defined-radio-for-engineers.html">Analog Device’s new SDR textbook</a>.  You can always use Google to recall trig identities or Shannon’s limit.  Think of this textbook like a gateway into the world of DSP and SDR; it’s lighter and less of a time and monetary commitment, when compared to more traditional courses and textbooks.</p>
<p>This textbook was designed specifically for students in Computer Science, although it can be used by anyone itching to learn about SDR who has programming experience.  As such, it covers the nessesary theory to understand DSP techniques, without the intense math that is usually included in DSP courses.  Instead of burying ourselves in equations, an abundance of images and animations are used, to help convey the concepts.  I believe that equations are best understood <em>after</em> learning the concepts through visual and experimental means.</p>
<p>In order to cover the foundational theory, an entire semester of “Signals and Systems”, a typical course within electrical engineering, is condensed down into a few chapters.  Once the basic DSP fundamentals are covered, we jump into using software-defined radios (SDRs), although DSP and wireless communications concepts continue to come up throughout the textbook.</p>
<p>Coding examples are provided in Python.  We use NumPy, which is Python’s standard library for arrays and high-level math, and comes with most Python installs.  We also use Matplotlib, which is a Python 2D plotting library, that provides an easy to use method for us to visualize signals, arrays, and complex numbers.  If you do not have Python programming experience, but are good with another scripting lanugage like MATLAB, Ruby, or Perl, then you will likely be able to follow along.  If you don’t have experience with any of these languages, and are a Computer Science student, then SDR should probably be reserved for down the road, as a language like Python will come in handy regardless of what field of Computer Science you enter after school.</p>
<p>OK, enough with the introductory material.  And no, I’m not going to waste valuable time explaining what software-defined radio is, you must have some idea already or you wouldn’t have gotten this far, plus you will figure it out for yourself within the first few chapters.</p>
<div class="section" id="contributing">
<h2>Contributing<a class="headerlink" href="#contributing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you get through any amount of this textbook and email me at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:sdr&#37;&#52;&#48;umd&#46;edu">sdr<span>&#64;</span>umd<span>&#46;</span>edu</a> with questions/comments/suggestions, then congraduations, you will have contributed to this textbook.</p>
<p>But on a more grand scale, you can help contribute to this textbook in the same way as any open source software project- through git.  This textbook might be hosted as a website, but the underlying material all lives on the textbook’s GitHub page (add link).  Feel free to submit an issue, or even a Pull Request (PR) with changes.  Those who submit valuable PRs will be permanately added to the acknowledgements section.  Not good at git but have changes to suggest?  Feel free to email me at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:sdr&#37;&#52;&#48;umd&#46;edu">sdr<span>&#64;</span>umd<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>.</p>
<p>The website this textbook is hosted on is ad-free, because we all hate ads.  I also don’t provide a paypal or bitcoin address where I accept donations.  There is literally no way for me to get paid for this textbook.  Instead, I merely suggest just trying to share this textbook with colleagues who may be interested in the material.</p>
