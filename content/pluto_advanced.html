<p>In this chapter we learn some more advanced topics related to the PlutoSDR.</p>
<div class="section" id="receive-gain">
<h2>Receive Gain<a class="headerlink" href="#receive-gain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Pluto can be configured to either have a fixed receive gain or an automatic one. An automatic gain control (AGC) will automatically adjust the receive gain to maintain a strong signal level (-12dBFS for anyone who is curious).  AGC is not to be confused with the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that digitizes the signal.  Technically speaking, AGC is a closed-loop feedback circuit that controls the amplifier’s gain in response to the received signal.  Its goal is to maintain a constant output power level despite a varying input power level.  Typically, the AGC will adjust the gain to avoid saturating the receiver (i.e., hitting the upper limit of the ADC’s range) while simultaneously allowing the signal to “fill in” as many ADC bits as possible.</p>
<p>The radio-frequency integrated circuit, or RFIC, inside the PlutoSDR has an AGC module with a few different settings.  (An RFIC is a chip that functions as a transceiver: it transmits and receives radio waves.)  First, note that the receive gain on the Pluto has a range from 0 to 74.5 dB.  When in “manual” AGC mode, the AGC is turned off, and you must tell the Pluto what receive gain to use, e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sdr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gain_control_mode_chan0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;manual&quot;</span> <span class="c1"># turn off AGC</span>
<span class="n">gain</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">50.0</span> <span class="c1"># allowable range is 0 to 74.5 dB</span>
<span class="n">sdr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rx_hardwaregain_chan0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">gain</span> <span class="c1"># set receive gain</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you want to enable the AGC, you must choose from one of two modes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sdr.gain_control_mode_chan0</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&quot;slow_attack&quot;</span></code></li>
<li><code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sdr.gain_control_mode_chan0</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&quot;fast_attack&quot;</span></code></li>
</ol>
<p>And with AGC enabled you don’t provide a value to <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rx_hardwaregain_chan0</span></code>. It will get ignored because the Pluto itself adjusts the gain for the signal. The Pluto has two modes for AGC: fast attack and slow attack, as shown in the code snipped above. The difference between the two is intuitive, if you think about it. Fast attack mode reacts quicker to signals.  In other words, the gain value will change faster when the received signal changes level.  Adjusting to signal power levels can be important, especially for time-division duplex (TDD) systems that use the same frequency to transmit and receive. Setting the gain control to fast attack mode for this scenario limits signal attenuation.  With either mode, if there is no signal present and only noise, the AGC will max out the gain setting; when a signal does show up it will saturate the receiver briefly, until the AGC is able to react and ramp down the gain.  You can always check the current gain level in realtime with:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sdr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_get_iio_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;voltage0&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;hardwaregain&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h2>Transmitting Over the Air Legally<a class="headerlink" href="#transmitting-over-the-air-legally" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Countless times I have been asked by students what frequencies they are allowed to transmit on with an antenna (in the United States).  The short answer is none, as far as I am aware.  Usually when people point to specific regulations that talk about transmit power limits, they are referring to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7ce538354be86061c7705af3a5e17f26&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt47.1.15&amp;rgn=div5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the FCC’s “Title 47, Part 15” (47 CFR 15) regulations</a>.  But those are regulations for manufacturers building and selling devices that operate in the ISM bands, and the regulations discuss how they should be tested.  A Part 15 device is one where an individual does not need a license to operate the device in whatever spectrum it’s using, but the device itself must be authorized/certified to show they are operating following FCC regulations before they are marketed and sold.  The Part 15 regulations do specify maximum transmit and received power levels for the different pieces of spectrum, but none of it actually applies to a person transmitting a signal with an SDR or their home-built radio.  The only regulations I could find related to radios that aren’t actually products being sold were specific to operating a low-power AM or FM radio station in the AM/FM bands.  There is also a section on “home-built devices”, but it specifically says it doesn’t apply to anything constructed from a kit, and it would be a stretch to say a transmit rig using an SDR is a home-built device.  In summary, the FCC regulations aren’t as simple as “you can transmit at these frequencies only below these power levels”, but rather they are a huge set of rules meant for testing and compliance.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it would be to say “well, these aren’t Part 15 devices, but let’s follow the Part 15 rules as if they were”.  For the 915 MHz ISM band, the rules are that “The field strength of any emissions radiated within the specified frequency band shall not exceed 500 microvolts/meter at 30 meters. The emission limit in this paragraph is based on measurement instrumentation employing an average detector.”  So as you can see, it’s not as simple as a maximum transmit power in watts.</p>
<p>Now, if you have your amateur radio (ham) license, the FCC allows you to use certain bands set aside for amateur radio.  There are still guidelines to follow and maximum transmit powers, but at least these numbers are specified in watts of
effective radiated power.  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Regulatory/Band%20Chart/Band%20Chart%20-%2011X17%20Color.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This info-graphic</a> shows which bands are available to use depending on your license class (Technician, General and Extra).  I would recommend anyone interested in transmitting with SDRs to get their ham radio license, see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arrl.org/getting-licensed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ARRL’s Getting Licensed page</a> for more info.</p>
